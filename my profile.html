<br> You hurt that person,
<br> You push them away.
<br> Not meaning to,
<br> But you do. </u>

<font color="red" font size="4" face="verdana"> At times...
<br> You are afraid,
<br> To go on, after this.

<b><font color="white" font size="4" face="verdana"> All you can do...
<br> Is hope that one day,

<br> You will meet again. </b>

<font color="white" font size="4" face="verdana"> And if, just by chance...
<br> You get that second chance,
<br> Remember the past.
<br> Learn from your mistakes,
<br> And never let them happen again.
